## Usage

1. `go run main.go`
2. fill in parameters as desired
3. click save
4. profile is saved as `profile.yaotl` if no name is specified.


## TODO

- [x] Allow users to specify file name
- [ ] Parse existing `yaotl` profile to allow GUI based modification of existing profiles.
- [x] Maybe add Monaco font to keep theming consistent with the Havoc client.
